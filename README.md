The data here was extracted from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and is freely accessible [here](http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/dataset/fisheries). I only selected the 2015 to 2017 data of three tuna species - bigeye tuna, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna. Furthermore, it only contains the tuna production of marine municipal fisheries.

This data set was used in my blog at: <insert url>
